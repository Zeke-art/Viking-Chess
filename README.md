# Viking-Chess
This project creates a fun way for users to think outside the box in this strategy board game that originated with the Vikings.
## Features
### Graphical game board
this will make use of pygame to make interactive surfaces
### win and lose logic
this will be the main game logic to determain if game pieces die and if players win
### challenges
I will need to learn more about pygame in order to make interactive game pieces on a board and maybe user mouse input to click where pieces are going instead of typing in coordinates
### Ideal outcome
My ideal outcome is making a game board with cool looking game pieces where the pieces move where the player wants them to using a point and click funciton
and have game logic that follows all the rules of Viking Chess
### minimal viable outcome
the bare essentials of this project is to have shapes of varying colors, two players, to move within a grid and to disappear when it is in a certain position

## Mile Stones
1. create basic graphical game board with different piecess
2. create point and click functionality to select and move pieces like online chess
3. create game logic that determains when pieces die, and when players win
